# Gym Database Management Project

To emphasise the importance of healthcare and fitness, we have built this example of a real-life gym. Our website allows people to sign up and choose their subscription packs or log in and check their schedules. This is done with the help of the vast database that we have developed and some back-end linking of the website to the database. The database contains all relevant information about the members, trainers, exercises, equipment, subscription packs and merchandise. The website also gives information about the gym as well as displays the merchandise available for purchase there. 

## Database Internals

This directory contains the back-end of the project. 

### Schema

This directory contains the ER diagram and the relation tables for this project.

### SQL Queries

This directory contains the queries to build the database. This entire database was built using PSql.

## Website

This directory contains the front-end of the project. We have built a relevant website using HTML, PHP, CSS and JavaScript for members to sign up to the gym and access their details. Detailed description is available in the [project report](https://github.com/GreeshmaKaranth/dbms-gym-project/blob/master/Report/Project_Report.pdf)
